    <h1>Privacy Policy – Futures Scan</h1>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 14 November 2025</p>

    <h2>1. General information</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application <strong>Futures Scan</strong> (the “App”)
        processes user data. The App is an <strong>educational tool for analysing crypto futures markets</strong>
        and studying technical setups in real time. The App is for informational and training purposes only
        and does not provide investment services, does not execute trades, and does not allow users to
        deposit, hold, or withdraw any funds or cryptocurrencies.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data controller</h2>
    <p>
        The data controller (if any personal data is processed) is:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Owner of the Futures Scan application</strong><br>
        Contact e-mail: <a href="mailto:your.email@example.com">your.email@example.com</a>
    </p>
    <!-- You may add your name / business name and postal address here if you want. -->

    <h2>3. What data we process</h2>
    <p>
        In the current test version of the Futures Scan App:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The App <strong>does not require creating an account</strong> and
            <strong>does not intentionally collect personal data such as name, e-mail address or phone number</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The App processes technical data necessary for it to function properly, in particular:
            <ul>
                <li>device information (e.g. model, operating system version),</li>
                <li>application error and crash information (logs),</li>
                <li>in-app settings stored locally on the device (e.g. selected pairs, filters, signal sensitivity).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data may be processed solely for the purpose of maintaining the App, improving its stability,
        and analysing general usage patterns (without identifying a specific individual).
    </p>

    <h2>4. No accounts, funds or trading execution</h2>
    <p>
        The App does <strong>not</strong> create or manage user trading accounts, does not connect to any
        exchange or broker using API keys, and does not execute, modify, or cancel any orders.
        The App does not accept deposits, does not hold any fiat currency or cryptocurrencies for users,
        and does not provide any wallet, custodial, brokerage or exchange services.
    </p>
    <p>
        All example signals, patterns and levels shown in the App are purely for educational and analytical
        purposes. Any real trading you decide to carry out must be done manually in your own exchange or
        broker account, outside of the App.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data sources</h2>
    <p>
        The App receives data from:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            the user – through settings and interactions with the interface, such as selection of pairs,
            trading style or filters;
        </li>
        <li>
            external exchange services – in the form of market data (prices, volume, candles), which do
            <strong>not contain any personal data of the user</strong>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
        The App may use services provided by Google or other entities, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Play (distribution of the app),</li>
        <li>Google Play Services (Android system services).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If additional services are used in the future (e.g. analytics, crash reporting),
        their names and functions will be added in updated versions of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Purposes of processing</h2>
    <p>
        The technical data described above may be processed for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>ensuring the proper operation of the App,</li>
        <li>improving stability and performance,</li>
        <li>detecting and fixing bugs,</li>
        <li>analysing anonymous usage patterns (e.g. which features are used most often).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Legal basis for processing</h2>
    <p>
        If personal data is processed, the legal basis may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>performance of a contract</strong> – processing is necessary to provide the App and its
            functions to the user;
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>legitimate interests of the controller</strong> – such as ensuring security, stability
            and development of the App.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Data retention</h2>
    <p>
        Technical data related to the operation of the App is stored for as long as necessary to achieve
        the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, in particular:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            user settings – until the App is uninstalled from the device or its data is cleared in system settings;
        </li>
        <li>
            error and crash logs – for the time needed to analyse and fix technical issues.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. User rights (where applicable)</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on applicable law (e.g. GDPR in the European Union), the user may have certain rights
        regarding their personal data, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>right of access to their data,</li>
        <li>right to rectification (correction),</li>
        <li>right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”),</li>
        <li>right to restriction of processing,</li>
        <li>right to object to processing,</li>
        <li>right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To exercise these rights, the user can contact the controller at the e-mail address provided above.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Data security</h2>
    <p>
        The controller takes reasonable measures to protect data against unauthorised access, alteration
        or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or mobile networks is 100% secure,
        and the controller cannot guarantee absolute security of the data.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Children</h2>
    <p>
        The App is not directed to children and is not intended for use by persons under 18 years of age.
        The App relates to trading and financial markets, which involve a high level of risk and are not
        suitable for minors.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, for example in case of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>changes to the App’s functionality,</li>
        <li>changes in the third-party services used,</li>
        <li>changes in applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The current version of the Privacy Policy will always be available at this URL.
    </p>
